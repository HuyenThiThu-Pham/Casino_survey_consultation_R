Predicting Public Opinion on a Proposed Casino in Toronto
Toronto’s City Council is considering the establishment of a casino in the community and seeks to understand public opinion on this matter. To gather insights, a survey was conducted to capture the views and opinions of residents. The survey comprised 11 questions aimed at:
• Understand residents’ attitudes toward a proposed casino 
• Assessing its alignment with Toronto’s image
• Gathering opinions on specific proposals and locations
The survey included a mix of open-ended questions and multiple-choice questions, allowing respondents the flexibility to express their views fully.
The original dataset has 17766 observations and 92 variables, this report will only focus on Q1 A, Q3 responses, and Gender to provide insights into public sentiment toward the casino proposal.
This report conduct multinominal logistic regression and PCA to predict a general feeling of respondents towards a new casino based on their answers from a survey data collected by City of Toronto. I also run EFA to find the main driving factors in popullation opinions.
